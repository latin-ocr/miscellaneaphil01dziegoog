INTRODUCTION. XXVII

as much (if not more) the substance to which it belongs, And whiteness
appearing in A is simply A turning white; it is the productiori, not ol
a thing, but oi the mode of a thing. Yet this mode is real, and so in
a sense accidents are realities and have real genera and species (p. 713
p. 72, l. 1—21). Here comes the difference between the proprium and
the accidens. The proprium (v. g. risibility in man) is so closely connected
with the abstract essence ol the substance that it can have neither genera
nor species in any sense. It is, however, a Universal, constant in all
Individuals os the same species or genus, whether the species be ultimate

or not. Sex, lor instance, is a property of all animab, and ‘animal' is a

genus. However, the proprium does not differ really Irom that ol which
it is predicated, just as genus, difference and species are not really
different; whereas the accident differs really Irom the essence oi the
thing (p. 72, l. 21-p. 75, I. 18).

The Proprium is, according to Porphyry, “quod inest omni, soli,
et semper”, always present in all individuals of a given class, and inno
others. The accident is what may be present or absent without the
destruction of its subject. Itis divided into separable and inseparablc:
inseparable in reality‚ when it is always Iound In a given individual,
though it may be thought as not present3 whilst the other Universals
are not even separable in thought. Even inseparable accidents can be
really separated by God's power; He can make a substance to exist
without accidents. And though whiteness is ‘the being white oI a sub·
stance’ it can also exist without its substance, since it has an essence
different therelrom (p. 75, l. 18 to p. 79, l. 8).

Chapter XIII. Proprium and Acciderat are said to inhere; the others
to be predicated. How many sorts oi Predicati0n are there? Predicati0n
being the union of subject and predicate, there are three sorts, greater,
less, and least, according to the perfectiori ol this union. The first is an
essential union between subject and predicate: ‘Man is an animated being’.
The second implies something real in, but not essential to, the subject:
‘This man is white’. The third implies something that is true ol the
subject, but not a real quality existing in it: ‘God is loved by me’. In
Holy Scripture we find that John the Baptist is Elias3 this agam is true,
but Elias is not really predicated of John the Baptist (p. 80 to p. 82,
l. 20). But iI Elias is truly yet not really John the Baptist, why should
it not be as true to say: ‘Peter is Pault’ Because Christ uttered this
