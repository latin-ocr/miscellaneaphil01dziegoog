lew remarks on genera more or less general, and species more ot leus
special, serve to conclude the chapter (p. 62, l. 32 to end; p. 63).

Chapter XI. The writer now comes to Specilic Difference, hy
which the genus is dividcd into species3 and he thereupon treats os
divisione. No genus can be adequately divided by means of one division
alone3 and the same may be said oi definitione, which contain the
dividing term, affirmed or denied (p. 64). Wyclii here allodes to what
are called cruos-divisione, as the example he gives shows plainly, 'l‘lre
number three is odd, prime, aud incomposite; that is, not produced by
the addition oi other numbers (unity not being considered aa anumber).
The example is irum Aristotle3 but it seems that ‘prime' is an annecte·
sary divisium only two numbers, 2 and 3, are ‘incomposite' in the sense
stated. And ‘odd’, il we add it to 'incomposite’, leaves the number 3,
whether we add ‘prime' or not (p. 65, l, 1-21').

This theory, however, is exposed to considerable difficulties, ‘lire
principalis that by introducing more than one principle oi division, the
genus is divided into species which orerlap, instead ol excluding each
other. Wyclii'n manner ol putting it ip. 65, 1, 21 to end; p, 66, 1. 1-13
is somewhat obscure. lt may be thus explained: Crosa-divisione introduce
dillerences which are not essentiahy contained within the genus. 11 we
divide animal, r. g. by two differentes which are independent oi meu
other, such as large and beautiful, and thece hy others ol the same
sort, we can never get to the ultimate species. Τ hic does not exyrlicitly
state that the divisione overlap within the genus, hut that they may
contain what is beyond it. As a lacn ii not comprised witirin tire genus,
