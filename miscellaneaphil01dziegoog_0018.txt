entities, since they are infinitely real and beautiful and perfect (p. 19,
l. 29 to end3 p. 20, l. 29).

Has everything that we can conceive a separate Idea? Isso,
to each of the infinite degrees of heat, cold, etc. which are possible,
we can conceive a separate corresponding Divine Idea. But these degrees
are not infinite3 we must admit in each genus one which is the highest
possible, and comprises all the others3 and it is to this one that the
Idea corresponds. For wherever we think of more and lenc, we also
think of most (p. 20, l. 29 to end of chapter). Here it may be allowed
to extend the old Scholastic argument given briefly in the text, in order
to make out Wyclif's meaning more thoronghly. Take, for instance, the
term strong3 A und B are both strong, but A is stronger than B. What
does this mean but that of all the possible members of the class A and B,
A is the strongest? Say now that strong is not restricted to A and B,
but includes athird, C3 either C is not so strong as B tin which case
A is still the strongest of the class A, B and C) or as strong (in which
case A and C are together the strongest members of that class) or
lastly C is stronger than A, and C is the strongest member of the class.
We may increase the class of ‘beings that are strong’, to any extent,
and we shall always find that, if we admit the notion of more and less,
one stronger than another, the notion of most necessarily follows, in the
sense of ‘that than which none is stronger’. Obviously this line of
argument is employable whenever the idea of more or less occurs, con·
nected with other terms, and no matter how many individuals the class
contains. Thus, if we take it that some men are more intelligent than
others from a given fixed point of view, and we take the class of ‘all
men at present existing’, there will be one man (or several men) most
intelligent of all in the sense Ι have given. Similarly, if we take the
class of ‘all men that have lived, five, or will live’. And lastly it will
also be true if we take the class of ‘all men that have lived, live, or
will or might live under any conceivable circumstances'. In every case,
more implies a ntost. This is extremely important for any student of
Scholastic Theology, for it gives the key to several demonstrations, espe-
cially to one concerning the existence and the attributes of God. (See
St. Thomas, Sum.Theol.1¹ P. qu. 11, art. 3 in corp. art. “Quarta via, etc.'’)

which the reality is not distinct from that of God, was not dealing with
