lNTRODUCTlON. XXXI

(8) “Every being is separately numerable3 therefore none can have
being in common with another.” — The same distinction should be made
here as in (7) (p. 104, l. 31—39).

(9) “Every being is an individual; therefore there is no universal
Being.” -·A like distinction should again be made. That by which
Universal Being is Universal Being — its formal essence - cannot bc
shared with many3 and if you call that alone individuality, nothing follows
But if you say that Being is individual, meaning that it can in no sense
belong to many individuals‚ we deny this (p. 104, l. 39 to p. 105, l. 11).

(10) “Every creature would be as identical with God as the Father
or the Son is identical with the Divine Essence.'’ - Itis almost im-
possible to explain the distinction given here without recurring to the
Latin terms used in the text. The Father‚ according to theologiam, is
tinum (ens) with the Son3 but He is not rrnns (Pater) with the Son. Iu
like manner, a horse, sor instance is unum (ens) with God, but not unus
(equus) with God. The argument makes the difference between God and
the creature to correspond between that ofa Divine Person and the
Godhead: which difference is not real but fictive. Wyclil, on the contrary,
says that it corresponds to the difference between the Persous, which

all Catholic theologians admit to he real (p. 105, l. 11 to p. 196, 116).

(11) “lf, because every man is a being, there is a Universal Being,
so, because every man is singular, there would be Universal Singularityl
This is absurd.'’ — Not if properly understood. Truth may be uttered
respecting falsehood, and universality may be predicated 01 singularity.

But there is no Universal Person; when we say ‘A Person’, this is a
mere abstraction 01 the mind3 and as soon as personality is abstracted‚
it ceases to be incommunicable. There is, in different senses, a singular
Universal and a Universal Singular (p. 106, l. 16 to end 01 chapter).
Chapter XVII. The adversaries urge that, “if the Universal Man
is singular, thenit (or he) is identical with the singular man, and there
remains only singular humanity”. — But this is an equivocation3 for we
do not say that the Universal is identical with its singular taken as an indi-
vidual. We mean no more than: Every man is this, that, or the other
singular, but is not one 01 them alone' (p. 108 to 109, l. 30). - ‘But’‚
it is said, ‘what does this, that, or the other stand sor? It must be for
one or more singular men, or 101 nothing at all; 11 101 the first, your
Universa! is only so many individuals3 il 101 the second, it does not
