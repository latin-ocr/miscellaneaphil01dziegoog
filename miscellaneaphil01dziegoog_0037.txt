exist’'. —We answer that there is noneed fo'r it to stand for anything
in particular. The subject of a proposition may be unreal, and yet the
proposition may be true; for instance, A Chimaera cannot run. One of
two alternatives is true; this is necessary in sensu composita, and false
in sensu diviso. We cannot say that the first alternative is true, nor that
the second is so (in sensu diviso); but we 313 obliged to admit that
one of the two -- we know not which, but take both together (in
sensu composito) - is necessarily true, with 3 ‘disjunctive existence’
(p. 109, 1, 30 to end of p. 110). - T0 show this distinction more
clearly still, I may be allowed to quote once more from Jevons’ Ele·
mentary Logic, which sets it forth far better than I could du. “The
Fallacy of Composition is a special case 01 equivocation, arising from
the confusion of an universal aud 3 collective term ..... We must not
argue that .. because each of the witnesses in a law case is liable
to give false or mistaken evidence, no confidence can be placed in the
concurrent testimony of a number of witnesses ..... The Fallacy of
Division is the converse of the preceding, and consists 13 using the
middle term collectively in the major premise but distributively in the
minor, so that the whole is divided into its parts. Thus 11 might be
argued: All the angles of a triangle are (together) equal to two right
angles; A B C is 33 angle of a triangle, therefore ΑΒ C is equal to two
right angles³'. lt is evident that the argument used by Wyclifs opponents
was 3 fallacy of Composition. They said: The Universal Man is identical
with the singulars A, Β, C therefore the Universal Man is identical
with all singular men, and is nothing more than they. Wyclif replied by
positing 3 ‘disjunctive existence' of the Universal in each, which is not
the same as singular existence.

What then is the nature of this ‘disjunctive existencei’. It consists
in being indifferent to and independent of the subjects in which it is
found. When we say. ‘One 01 these tw0‚ Αο1 Β, must be true’‚ we
predicate the existence of truth as certain3 but this existence is not more
bound to A than to B.· The Universal then, being to the Particular as
F orm is to Matter, may be either contingent or necessary3 the Particular
here meaning thegeneral term with Some prefixed to it: Every man is

some man. As matter is vague and indeterminate untildetermined by its
form, so Some man is in comparison with Every man a vague and
indeterminate object of thought lp. tit—p. 113, l. 11), Wyclif says that
