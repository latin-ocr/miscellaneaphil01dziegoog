INTRODUCTION. XLI

he defines substantial and occidental surm, and draws certain corollarics
srorn these premises, which no doubt were to serve for the sull solution:
hut the first part coines to an end here, and we find nothing more on
the subject.

Second Part (p. 17 3 to the end of the work). llere we have two
questions answered. The lirst, is (p. 173, l. 2, 3) Whether the Universals
have only ideal being in the Divine Mind3 the second seems to be, so
sar as I can judge, Whether the Universals are really distinct from their
singulars. To the first he answers (p. 173, l. 3, 43 p. 175, l. 14, 15)
that we must admit the Dixine ldeas ol all things; and (p. 175, l. 38,
39) that every creature, in its intelligible being, is God. He nowhere
states explicitly that the Unirersals hare only ideal Being in God; hut
this is easy to gather from the whole sense of p. 174. -· As to the
second question, he on p. 179, l. 4, 5, alter having described the various
sorts ol UniversalS, and enumerated the various opinions concerning
them, declares distinctly that there is no Universal that is really and
essentially different from its singulare. Such an opinion is, perhaps
wrongly‚ ascribed to Plato by Aristotle. Yet the Universal has an entity
of its own, and differs froin its singulars by a formal difference only;
but each Universal differs really from erery other.

Such are the live tractates‚ or fragments ol tractam, which are

now published. Either by reason ol their original imperfectioris, or by
those which the copyists hare introduced, they are far less easy to
analyze than the works contained in the first volume. Yet even the short
and inadequatc analysis which l have giren shows here and there many
llashes ol prosound thought, not unworthy ol the great thinker who
wrote these tractates
