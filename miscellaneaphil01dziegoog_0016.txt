lNTRODUCTlON. XI

This argument may perhaps be put a little more clearly. There is
something in common between a scal and the impression actuallystamped
upon it, and the scal is therefore identical with the impression to some
extent. But if so far identical, it must also be in so far identical with
the signet which gives the impression3 for that which is common to both
copy and pattern must be the same in both (p. 13, l. 29 to end; p. 14,
l. 1-4). The argument is subtle, but perhaps a little too subtle, and

Isuspect that the author's opponents would join issue with him on

this point.

lf then we can say: “Any creature in its ideal nature is God”;
can we conclude: “Therefore any creature is God?‘' No3 lor the usual
sense of the words would mean that any creature is Gorl without
restrictions. When a restrictive term is used to qualify a term, we cannot
conclude anything by eliminating this restriction. A man is a good
burglar: we cannot thence conclude simply that heis good. And therefore
if, by saying that a creature is God in a certain sense, i. e, in its
intelligible being, we scandalize the weak, it is better to avoid saying so
(pfl. 14, l. 4-30). The question, however, cannot be thus eluded, and
no doubt Wyclifs adversaries urged the point more than once to the
admission that, in a sense, any creature was God. The argument certainly
seems to mean identity a parte rei. A being is identical with its own
finite measure of existence; therefore it is also identical with its Ideal,
or supreme measure of existence, in so far as there is something really
common between the two, lf Wyclif means this, he exposes himself to
the objection: “Then, in some sense, we are really identical with God!‘’
If he means only an analogy, or a figure of discourse, he escapes the
difficulty, but his argument seems to fail. And indeed ldo not remember
to have met with the same line of reasoning anywhere else3 it was
probably abandoned later for the notion of Transcendental Entity‚
common both to God and the Creature, but in two different and only
analogical senses.

To the objection just noted, our author replies: lt is strange that
modern logicians and theologians should he so squeamish about this
identity of merely ideal existence, when, according to them, the Word
might assume, not only the nature ol man, but that of a brute; and
an ass might be God. And since (again according to them) all things
are necessary in God, and what is necessary must be true, then an ass
