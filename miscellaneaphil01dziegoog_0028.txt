considered which lends itself to this distinction, but merely upon the
action of the thinking mind; and distinctio rationis ratiocinatoe, in which
the nature of the thing considered lends itself to the distinction. For
example, we ate forced to think God as merciful and just, separating
the two ideas in our mind; but in reality His justice and His mercy are
the same, and are both identical with God's Essence. But when we think
of Plato as a philosopher and a poet, the same man is both, and there
is no real distinction at all between the two, Yet Socrates, not being
both by his nature, happens to be such that be can be considered from
either point of view3 and to consider him only as a poet, or only as a
philosopher, would not give us a false, but only an inadequate idea of
the man. Reot distinction, on the other hand, was affirmed when the
things thought of differed in themselves and anteriorly to being thought,
and this realis distinctio was either major or minor, either sicut res
differt a re, or sicut res diffm a modo ipsius rei. There were other,
but less Important divisione. -- Now Duns Scotus tried to introduce a
distinction that was less than any realis distinctio, and yet greater than
any distinctio rationis. lt was the distinctio formatis a natura rei. The
same man is animal and rational; and therefore the distinction between
animality and rationality, taken as factors of the idea Mon, is a notional
distinction merely. But animality, taken in itself, is oporteret lndependent
of rationality taken in itself‚ since animality can really exist without being
accompanied by rationality3 and on the other hand, as rationality cannot

exist without animality, the former depends upon the other. But if of two

things one is independent of the other and the second dependent on the .
first whether we think of them oront, there must be a real distinction,
but on one side only. A formal distinction was therefore a distinction
which in one respect was merely notional, and was real in another. It
is pretty generally agreed among Scholastics at the present day that
this s0·called distinctio formalis ought to be classed amongst the
distinctiones rationis ratiocinator: though very few, l sear, understand
what Scotus really meant, and for what purpose he introduced these
Jornralitotes.

Chapter X. That which answers to the question, What is this? is
the essence of a thing, and this answer being generally true of all things
bearing the same name, the essence of anything must be universah and
the more universal the more perfect it is, There must be a most anda
