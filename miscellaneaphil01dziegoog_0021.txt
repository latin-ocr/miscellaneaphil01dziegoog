Contradicti0n3 the denial is merely verbal, not real. Our own nature y
irresistibly impels us to admit the Universals3 and since we cannot l
destroy nature, why not yield to it? (p. 31, l. 28 to end os chapter).
Chapter VII. We have then Universal Entity, first object os the ζ
mind, predicated in many and of many subjecta yet not belonging to ζ
any of the five Predicables (Genus, Species, Difference‚ Property‚ and
Accident) though more truly existing in its subjects than any ol these3 l
and als0‚ by that same existence in a subject, distinct from the Ideal Ϊ
Exemplars‚ which baveno such formal existence. As God is a common ¹
Form in the Three Divine Persona, so Entity is a common form in every ,
being without exception (p. 33). - In the marginal notes I put inadver- ,
tently, “Sometvltat like the Deity’'‚ etc. I now think that the restriction
ought to be erased; and indeed there is nothing in the text to imply ,
any restriction. ll we go through Wyclis's philosophical works‚ we shall
always find him consistently delending his position by reference to the
Divine Essence and the Holy Trinity. The genesis of his system may
perhaps be stated thus. He had arrived at the conviction that there are
Real Universals, and Entity, the most universal of all; the subordinate
Universals are distinct one from another somehow, and somehow from ’
the supreme Universal, Entity. What was the distinction, and how was
it to be understood so as neither to fall into Pantheism on one hand,
non to the denial of reality to the Universals on the other? Here Wyclif
bethought him ol the mystery' of the Holy Trinity‚ in which the Divine
Essence is each of the Three Persons‚ distinct therelrom only by a
logical distinction (distinctio rationis), whilst the Three are really distinct
srom each other, though One in the Unity of God. If (we may suppose
he thought) Entity is assumed as the common form of all beings, God
and His creatures alike, which are notwithstanding really different [rom
each other, as the Father is different from the Son, we have a stand-
point that is impregnable‚ since any argument to prove that such a
distinction is absurd would be tantamount to a denial ol the doctrine of
the Church. As there are Three Persons in One God, so there are
many particulars and One Being. He thus avoided saying that ‘Man is
God', since (in his view) there is the same relation between Man and
God, as between the Father and the Son3 now the Father is noe the
Son. Yet they are both the same Being, just as both the Father and
the Sonare God. This ol course was open to the objection that he
