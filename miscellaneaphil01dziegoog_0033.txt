proposition, making it true figuratively. Was the goat which Abraham
sacrificed figuratively Christ, since it was a figure of Christ? No, sor not
every figure is figuratively identical with the thing it represents. Some
are, some are uot; God alone knows why. Such a form ol predication
is only true within its own limits3 is taken to mean another kind of
predication, it becomes false (p. 82, l. 20 to p. 84, l. to). -This
theory, lrom some points of view, is identical with that which in Wyclils
later works served him to explain the Eucharistic Prese'nce ol Christ.
But in the latter he maintains that the ‘figurative identity’, really true,
can be called real; and in De Aposlasia lie even maintains that the
Paschal Lamb, being the figure ol Christ, ruas Christ, though less per-
fectly so than the Host. These developments naturally sprang from the
idea here already expressed, that Christ’s words have the power of
bestowing on a subject and a predicate some sort of identity that could
not exist without them.

llere he openly combats the assumption that ‘truly’ means 'really'.
ll it did, since the Father is truly different from the Divine Essence, He
would be really so. Probably Wyclif came later to find this distinction
untenable, since the Father is not truly different from the Godhead, but
only according to our imperfect mode of thinking, which distinguishes
what is identical in itself, just as we think separately of Edward Vll and
ol the King os England. And this is the more likely when we sind him

admitting that his sketch of the matter is inadequate, and requires com-

pletion and possibly correction (p. 84, l. 10 to p. 85, l. 29). -
We prove these three degrees of predication by the principle that

all difference of perfection, such as may be found in predication, implies
uot only a positive, but a comparative and a superlative as well. And
εις, taking a greater, a less and a least within each ol these degrees ol
entitative perlection, we have the nine choirs os Angels, so we get nine
degrees ol predicative union‚ of which examples are given. There are
also other divisions in this matter (p. 85, l. 29 to end of chapter).
Chapter XIV. 'l‘he socalled Expositorial Syllogism being closely
connected with predication, Wyclif here proceeds to examine it. Its
general form requires the middle term to be a singular, and it is much
used in different ways to a combat the theory ol Universals. Leaving the
detailed examination ol this syllogism to another tractate, various fallacies
proceediug more or less from the abuse ol this argument will here be
