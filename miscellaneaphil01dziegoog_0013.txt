INTRODUCTION.

ΙΙ. Analysis of the De Universalibus.

Chapter I. (pp. 1-6.) Wyclif begins by proving the existence 01
Real Universals from the doctrine 01 Divine ldeas, or ideal archetypes
01 311 created things, etemally existent in God, Itis probable that this
proof, placed first here, was also first in order 01 time amongst the reasons

which led to his conversion to Realism srom the prevailing Nominalism
01 the Oxford Schools. The discrepancy, not to say the contradiction,
between the doctrine 01 the World 01 Archetypes (so general amougst
the early Fathers that it was almost a dogma 01 the Church, so univer-
sally admitted that St. Augustine did not hesitate to say: “He who denies
them is an infidel‘) and the tenets 01 Nominalism, must have struck
Wyclif from the first. F or these patterus 01 things, or Archetypes, where
and what are they? They are in God’s mind, and therein endowed
with eternal existence and reality3 they correspond to the many indivi-¹
duals in the created world -the Ideal man to the multitude 01 created
man, and so lorth: therefore they are Universals. To deny them were
to stand convicted 01 infidelity by the authority 01 Augustine3 but as soon
as Wyclif's youthlul mind accepted them, he accepted them with all the
consequences that he thought they contained. God certainly knows man
not only as this or that particular man, but in his essence as a human
being, and all other beings likewise (p. 2, 1. 20 top. 3, l. 25). This
cannot be identical with the essence 01 any individual as known by God,
since it applies equally to all individuale, and they therefore cannot be
its proper and distinct object What then is that distinct object? It can
be nothing else but Created Humanity, etemally known by God as
Creatable Humanity. And if the ldea is 01 something, surely it is 01
something real; and il the Idea 01 the Particular and 01 the Universal
Man are distinct, no doubt the Particular aud the Universal Man must
be distinct als0, unless we deny truth to these Divine ldeas (p. 3, 1. 25
to p: 4, 1. 5). These, having lor objects things which are distinct, must
be distinct one from another, though not from God (p. 4, 1. 4—14);
must be distinct lrom their objects, since the copy cannot be the same
as the pattern (ib, 1. 14-22), and cannotbe denied, is we admit that
God knows all things from all etemity tib„ l. 22—38).

Chapter Il. The Divine Essence is as it were a mirror in which
all possible created things are reflected, and this reflectiou is the ldeal
