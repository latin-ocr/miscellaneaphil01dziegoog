the effect. He is, therefore, more universal as its cause3 it is more
universalia predication only. The mere universality of a predicate does
not argue its perlection, Perfection‚ however, generally lollows3 and
always in the case ol creatores, il the predication be formal (i. e. essen·
tial to the subject) (p. 95, l. 12 to end of chapter). ¹

Chapter X VI. (3) “Transcendent Entity, being caused, cannotbe God,
the uncaused3 yet it is God, according to this theory”. - a) In so lar as it
is caused, it is something that is not-God3 but we cannot conclude thence
that it is simply not God, i. e. that its idea excludes that ol God. h) It
comprises non-Deity, but it comprises Deity also, c) The argument would
only have weight if we were so absurd as to maintain that the Universal
is formally singular; lor the Singular alone is unable to be predicated

at the same time of contradictory subjects. The answers b) and c) are

the best, but a) is simplest, and sulfices: and these answers show us
where we can argue from the affirmative, A is a not-B, to the negative,
A is not B, and where we cannot (p. 99—p. 102, l. 30).

(4) “The goodness ol any being would be infinite, since it has

Trancendental Entity”. - Not if the possession be only partial and ⁴

finite. But the adversary retorts that this either means: A thing is at the
same time lmitely and infinitely good (since ‘to have infinite goodness'
is ‘to be infinitely good’), or means nothing. We deny this; to have
goodness is not the same as to be good. And if he insists, then we say
that no creature can have infinite essential goodness (p. toa-103,
1, 36).

(6) “God and a stone would be one, since they would have
absolutely the same entity’'. - ll ‘absolutely’ is meant to determine the
thing which is Transcendental Entity, we have merely the statement that
one and the same thing is a stone, and is God, Il itis taken to deter-
mine the affirmation of identity, then astone would be God3 a heresy
which we deny (p. 103, l. 36 to p. 104, l. ιι).

(7) “There would be only one Reing, since Entity is numerically
one, and all things would be identical therewith”. - But ‘numerically
one’ means in the usual sense a being that is one and cannot exist in
many numerically distinct individuals; in that sense we must deny that
Entity is numerically one. Entity is one in itself, yet may be 'sbared by
many3 and if that is meant by ‘numerically one', the argument sails

lp. 104, l. 11—31).
