IV. Analysis ot the Notae et Questiones Variae.

Itis almost impossible to analyze a text so corrupt as this. Itis
better then to take the two most salient passages. From p. ι 58 to
p. 161. Wyclif examines the question whether every trnth has a corre·
sponding falsehood. By lalsehood we cannot mean non-entity² sor then
we would mean nothing (p. 159, l. 5-10); it is an entity, the belief that
something which is, is not. Now the First Truth (There existe a God)
can have no corresponding salsehood, since that would be an entity, and
absolutely bad, even as God is absolutely good; but nothing is absolutely
bad. Nor can the Second Truth (Creatures exist) have a corresponding
salsehood. That, il it existed, would be the worst of all things; and
there is no such ‘worst’. — And consequently since these truths, which

are entities, make up the sum of being, no truth can have an opposite

salsehood: for no entity has a contradictory non-entity. — Waiving sor
a moment the peculiar theories ol Wyclil's system, we cannot but admit
that this last argument sheds light upon many a modern controversy.
Hegel has assumed, as all know, that Being and Non-Being are one and
the same, since to he thought ol is to be, and Non-Being is thought os.
As Wyclil points out, Non-Being is not, and cannot be, the contradictory
ol Being. When we say Some Non-Being is a Being, we say true in a
certain sense3 when we say, Some Not man is a man, we say what
cannot possibly he true. Yet the first proposition, as it stands, looks as
sels-contradictory as the second. As a matter ol lact, Being is not taken
in the same sense in the subject as Being in the predicate; we have two
different terms, though there is acertain analogy between them. The
Principle of contradiction (pace Hegell) thus remains unassailable, since
it only affirma that you cannot assert and deny at the same time the
same thing in the same sense. Non-Being is* something thought of, but it
is not thought os in the same way as Being thought ol without the
negatiou. In the same way, il it should be said: What is not thought of
is thought ol: “It is‚’' we answer, “but it is thought ol negatively, whilst
the predicate Though! os embraces every manner of thinking.” These
subtleties are worth while noticing, since the name ol their inventor is
Hegel.

Another point, which touches the very essence os Wyclit's theory,
is that All positive entities exist in one srrst mode ol being, and couse-
