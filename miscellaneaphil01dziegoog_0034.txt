refuted. “Every thing is singular, and Realists affirm th'at Universals are
things'’. Yes, but they deny that every thing is singular; for Universal
things cannot be singular. “Substance is identical with ass, and ntan with
substance’'. But this gives no conclusion, since Subslance ought to be,
and is not, taken distributively. One might by a like argument prove
the Father to be the Son. The syllogism is worthless unless we say
(which we do not) that Substance is identical with each particular man
(1287 to p. 89, l. 3).

Aristotle expresses himself differently3 'a statue, according to him,
is not a stone, but is of stone. But this is only a difference of language:
lo be of stone is to be a sione moclified in a certain inan· and in like
manner the Father is God from a certain point of view. Any other
manner of arguing lands us in heresy or in absurdity3 or would land us
in heresy were it not for the formal declarations of the Church. They
are therefore, dangerous and sophistical subtleties (p. 89, l.3 to end of
chapter). , , ’
Chapter XV. Wyclif here formulates (ppt to p. 94, l. 6) thirteen
objections, most of them bearing on the doctrine of Transcendent Being,
common to God and His creature, and proceeds to answer them. We
give the objections together with the answers.

(ι) “lf there is Transcendent Entity, there will be also transcendent
beauty, common both to God and the creature3 for entity and beauty
imply one another. Every creature would be beautiful with the infinite
beauty of God‘'. - We must admit, however, the existence of Trans·
cendent Entity, since we conceive it distinctly, apart from the entity of
particulare, and in thinking of it, we certainly think of something. But
the argument is worthless. The Finite possesses the infinite beauty of
God, but not infinitely (p. 94, l.6 to p. 95, l.12). This same distinction
serves also to answer the fifth objection, viz„ that God would be no
better than the lowest of His creatures. For though God and the creature

have the same entity, God has it in an infinitely more perfect manner

than the creature. Resides He possesses special attributes which He alone
can possess (p. 95, l. 12-3ol, ln the text, the preceding objection is
numbered as the seventh. This is a copyist's mistake no doubt.

(2) '‘Transcendent entity would be more divine, being universal,
than God Himsell”. - N0, for He is the cause ol that entity3 and His
own incommunicablc Reing is anterior to the other, ns thc cause is to
