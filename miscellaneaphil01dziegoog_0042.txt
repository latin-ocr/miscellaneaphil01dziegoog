INTRODUCTION. XXXVII

that ln ,view of the great advantage which accrues to us thereby, no
one should deny the Universals, if not certain that they do not exist,
and it is impossible to attain such certitude. Men who have a common
board (this looks like a hit at some monastic opponents) ought not to
be so set against a common humanity. “For mysell,” he sayS, “1 rejoice
to share therein, and Ι feel that it deserves iar more praise and love
than my own individuality.”

111. Analysis ot the Fragmenta.

As the writer declares on p. 256, l. 16, 17, “Suppono quedam
tradita in 3⁶⁵⁰ tractatu loyca Magistri Iohannis Wyclis,” we are, as l
said before, entitled to regard these pages as at least inspired hythe
Master, though written by a disciple. But nowhere else in his printed
works does Wyclis give such desperate and uncompromising directions
lor the defendet in an exercise of ‘Obligations’3 and most likely they
were only sor use in cases ol extreme danger, and when the defender
was very hard pressed. Ι have already stated at some length (Logica,
rol, l. Introduction, pp. XXVII—XXX) what I suppose this exercise to
have been, and need not repeat it here.

There are three modes of answering in the Exercise os obligations,
The first consists in admitting the premises of the syllogism separately,
and denying them, il taken together so as to form a copulative. And is
they be not thus taken together, it is still possible to deny the con·
clusion os any syllogism; lor it is impossible to prove that the conclusion
is right without a copulative proposition, which can always be denied
ip, 152 t0 153, Ι. 26). This looks a good deal like an ahuse ol dialectical
subtlety; for then any argument, however powerlul‚ might be rendered
worthless. For instance: “All men are mortal aud Englishmen are men’',
might be denied, whilst we admit each of the parts separately3 and it
becomes very hard indeed to prove the copulative syllogistically when
there is no direct denial os its parts. And the writer remarks (p. 154,
1.5ο-55’) that this and the following mode ol defence are available
not only in Obligations, hut in other arguments (indifferenter in casu vel
extra casum). But no doubt it was a convenient way os getting out of
a tight place.
