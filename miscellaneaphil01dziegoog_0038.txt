INTRODUCTION. XXXIII

this is hard to understand, even hy philosophers (difficillime a philosophis

et 310111 Impossibiliter a grossis est secundum hunc modum apprehensibile,
p. 112, l. 34, 35); and Ι willingly admit that the general drilt 01 this
passage seems very obscure. Continuing 'his comparison with matter, he
remarks that as matter may be manilold, so there may be many such
vague, particular, yet 1101 singular, objects. This passage too, at such a
distance 01 time and without the means 01 kuowing any more about the
question than our author chooses to say, -— seems to me ‘difficillime
apprehensibile'3 and as 1 frankly confess in a loot-note (p. 113) con-
cernIng the two following paragraphs, 1 must rank mysels amongst the
grossi, to whom the apprehension 01 these thIngs is as it were impossible
(p. 113, l. 11 to p. 114, 1. 40). The chapter closes with some further
remarks about Particularity, as distinct both 11011 Singularity and 110111
Universality, properly so called (p. 114, 1. 40 to p. 115, 1. 30).

Chapter XVIII. The first three pages (p. 115 to p. 118, l. 20
are relatIvely without interest, being merely a continuation 01 the lormer
remarks, and winding up with the assertion that the difficulty consists in
pointing out what thing corresponds to the truth 01 disjunctive propo·
sitions, and consequently (I may say) ol particular propositions in general.
For a particular proposition, v. g. ε8011111101 runs’ is equivalent 10 11
indefinite number 01 disjunctives, containing all the singulars under Every
Man: ‘The man A, 01 the man B, or ..... the man Z 1113. Butl must
here explain a point which, il 1111 unexplained would seem not lar
removed from absolute absurdity. On p. 115, and again on p. 118, Wyclif
declares that a disjunctive may be true when neither 01 113 parts 111
11111; and he gives us an example: 1 speak orl do not speak. Now it
looks as 11 there could be no time when 1 neither speak nor do not
speak. Such, however, is nothis meaning. The disjunctive proposition is
true, — when? Eternally. Now neither 1 speak 1101 Ι do not speak is
eternally true. 11 we understand thus the “pro aliqua mensura vel aliquo
tempore” on p. 116, 1. 10, and p. 118, l. 5, 6, the whole meaning 01
the two passages is quite clear.

At this point, our author examines the question 01 the luherence
01 the Universal 11 its particulars. As there are three kinds 01 difference
and 01 predication, so there are also three degrecs 01 inherence. When
lsay: “My right eye or my lestis necessary to see”, “Necessary to

see'’· belongs in lact either to 0111 eye or the other, but raguely and
111 Unlversalibus. C
