INTRODUCTION.

The present volume of Wyclil’s Miscellanea Philosopltica, which
with the works already published contains all his philosophical writings,
whether spurious, doubtful, or authentic, with the exception of his great work

De Enle, is not less interesting than the first, but presents fewer new
points of interest. All that Ι wrote concerning Wyclif's philosophy in my
Introductory Essay to the first volume applies of course to the second,
as it may also be truly said to apply to every oue of his works.
lt will therefore be unnecessary to write a ve'ry elaborate Introduction3
a few remarks concerning the manuscripts, their authenticity and date,
and the analysis of the text of each work, seems to be sufficient.

lwould however point out, in regard to possible shortcomings
and mistakes, that lhave been still worse off for the editing of this
volume than for the former one. ln the first, it is true, De Actibus
Anima· was copied from the only manuscript extant3 but for the Repli-
catio de Universalibus Ι had tw0, and for the De Materia et Forma
as many as five manuscripts to consult. But in the editing of the present
volume l have had in every case to do with unique manuscripts3 which
of course immensely increased my labours and difficulties. Add to this
the fact that the writing is in both MSS. very careless and illegible,
as mucb so as (l will not say, more than) the worst specimens 1 have
met with in Logica or elsewhere; and occasional slips will, lhope,
be readily accounted for and forgiven. Mr. Matthew has, as ever, been
ready with bis unfailing help and suggestions, some of much worth,
of which Ι have been glad and thanlrful to avail myself. My hearty
thanks are also due to Dr. Furnivall, who though anxious to see the
volume terminated as soon as possible, and doing his best to hasten
its slow progress through the press, has nevertheless understood my
position, and the conflicting claims of speed and thoroughness, which
l have indeed attempted to conciliate au well as Ι could.
