XIV' INTRODUCTION.

Real Universals properly so called, for God’s ldeas are not only real
beings in a very peculiar sense, but they are also Universals in a very
peculiar'sense, i. e. because they inlluence the existence of many par-
ticulars as their archetypes. He now proceeds to prove the Universals
proper, viz, those which exist in created things.

Everything good is good 3ηά pleasing to God. He sees it 3ηά wills
it. But what is it then that He sees 3ηά wills? No answer can be given
to this question, other than: That common goodness which is in all
creatures. li we do not admit any common goodnesS, then God sees
nothing that is common 'to all; the proposition that “Everything good is
good” becomes unmeaning; and yet it is necessarily true. If, on the
contrary, we admit 3 common goodness which is in every created
nature as such, we shall by a like reasoning be forced to admita
common humanity in all men, and so forth. And a denial would subvert
the whole ol our Catholic saith and practice, and even obedience to the
Kins (v- 23-25‚ 1· v)- ’

Again, is the Scholastic axiom, that Every Being is good, be true,
it follows that universal goodness belongs to Being. This, known by
God, and including His own goodness, is something neither created nor
increate, but abstracted srom the idea of God and oi His creatures3 il
abstract, then universal (p. 25, 1, 9-28).

Resides, it is absurd to say that our knowledge ol Nature extends
only to the propositione made concerning it; we must know what the

propositions signifiy. Now this is in every case something universal. And

even in practical matters, we know that a groat is worth more than a
sarthing. This is not only 3 knowledge of the proposition, but oi the
Universals, Every groat, and Every sarthing. A man is universally and
really an animal: can thisbe, without animal being something universal
3ηά real? No more than there can be mighty labour without might. ‘A
man being an animal’ depends on ‘All men being animals’ (cf. Repli-
catio de Universolibus, W's Miscell. Phil. vol. l, p. 133), and this is the
dependency of the Particular upon the Universal. We know this by the
dependency osone proposition upon another3 God knows it without their
aid, and directly. Ii one man had nothing really in common with another,
all men would be as different from each other as men are from stones.
Resemblance cannot proceed from mere particularity, which only makes
one thing not to be another (p. 25, 1. 28 to p. 27, 1. 34).
