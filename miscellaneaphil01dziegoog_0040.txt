INTRODUCTION. ’ XXXV

Chapter XX. Possibly following· up the idea of ‘abstract Universals',
Wyclif now proceeds to state that some are simply real, sotne potentially
real, and some merely conceptual, or pure abstractions. There is only

one sun, but by a miracle there might be many. The sun istherefore

a potential Universal, which in the ordinary course of nature exists only
in one singular. If we admit St. Thomas’ doctrine that each angel is of
a different species which cannot possibly exist in more than one individual,
we shall still be able to conceive the Universal of each species of angel,
though this is only Universal in our minds (p. 127, l. 1-27). Thus
there are three degrees of Universality‚ from greatest to least: actual,
potential, and merely conceptual; though these degrees have nothing to
do with the entitative perfection of the singulars. Of the last (conceptual)
we may say that we ought to follow the doctrine of St. Thomas con·
cerning Angels, and consequently admit in their case only conceptual
universality. These three degrees are in close connection with the degrees
of essential difference above mentioned (p. 127, l. 27 to end of chapter).

Chapter XXI. Wyclif returns to the question already dealt with
before, viz„ whether there can be any Universal which is never existent
in any of its singulars, and he proceeds hereupon to classify the ten
categorica -- substance and the nine sorts of accidentS, which are the
substance as perfeeted in three ways (quidditatively, qualitatively‚ and
quantitatively) aod in three degrees (little, more, and most). These, com·
bined, gite nine determinatione of Substance, but it is very difficolt -
if we admit (though this is doubtful) that the Nine Categories of A'r'istotle
rightly correspond to these divisione of Substance -— to show how and
in what sense they correspond; we may let the question drop (p. 131
to p. 135, l. 3ο). Notwithstanding we can show that there must be ten
categories and not more, but omit for want of space many arguments
by which this division can be proved (p. 135, l. 3ο to p. 137, l. 13).
Now these ten categories have under them species of which they consist3
and if any species were wanting, they would therefore be mutilated3
which is contrary to God’s wisdom and power. But certain species will
not exist after the Day of Judgment (p. 137, l. 13 to end of chapter).

Chapter XXII examines whether Universals have more perfect entity
than their respective singulare. lt must be so, for no number of singulars
can equal the perfectiori of the species. Yet the individual Man, not the

Unit·ersal,·is the image of God and of the Trinity. lf then intellectual
