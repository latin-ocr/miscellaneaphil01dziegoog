XXXIV INTRODUCTION.

without exclusion of inherence in either (the examples given here' aro
mine, not Wyclif's). When Ι say: “A or B is the first boy in the class”,
“First boy in the class” belongs to A or to B, we know not to which
of the two, yet we know that it belongs distinctly to one, exclnding the
other. This is a higher form of inherence, since the vagueness is only
in our thought, notin the fact. The lowest of these forms, being the
least perceptible, has been denied by some, who are too deeply plunged
in the senses to perceive it. The highest is when aUniversal is affirmed
of many together: as, “All men are mortal”. “Mortal’ belongs to each
man separately and to the whole multitude of singular men together. The
cavils of our opponente procced from their not distinguishing between
these various sorts of inherence, and are answered victoriously by means
of this distinction (p. 118, 1. 20 to end of chapter).

Chapter XIX. Wyclif replies to the objection numbered (13), inter·
verting the order of the objections stated in Ch. XV. “The Proprium,
or property, is not part of the essence of the species, yet it is common
to all: ln what subject then does the Universal Proprium inhere? When
we say, “Man is capable of laughter”, Capable os lauglrter does not
belong merely to individual man, being common to all; nor to the species,
since the Universal Man is not capable of laughter”. There are several
answers, One is that “capable of laughter'’ is nothing buta peculiar
standpoint from which the species Man is considered, and therefore is
objectively identical with Man. But the faculty of laughing varies in the
individuals in which it is found (p. 122). Again‚ we may say that the
proposition means only that every man, qud man, is capable of laughtcr3
here man is taken, neither as an individual nor a species, but as something
between; and we have theological instances which authorize us to do so
(p. 123, l.1·-37). For we may consider the Universal man either without
reference to the subjects in which it inheres, or with such reference3 in
the frrst case, the species man cannot laugh, in the second it can
(p. 123, l. 37 to p. 124, l. 24). There are also other answers which
amount nearly to the same3 and by means of these or similar answers,
difficulties concerning accidental Universals are also solved. We must,
however, remark that though we speak of species and genera in
aceldema, these are mere abstractions - not realities like the essential
differences of substances one from another (p. 124, l. 24 to end of
chapter).
