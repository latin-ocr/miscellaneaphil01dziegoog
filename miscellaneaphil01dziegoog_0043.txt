XXXVIII INTRODUCTION.

The second mode of answering consisted in admitting or denying
the premises as may be more convenient, but always denying the con·
clusion. And if it be argued: You ought to admit this conclusion, for
you know it is logically drawn; answer: “To he logically drawn is not
enough, the conclusion must not make me contradict myself3 and therefore
l deny it.” lf v. g. you admit that Every man runs, deny its contra-
dictory (that some man does not run); then, should the opponent say:
“You do not run and you are a man;’' you can also admit this, but deny
the conclusion, as landing you in seli-contradiction (p. 153, l. 26 to
p. 154, l. 35). This mode too seems to savour somewhat of quibbling.
lt may be doubted, indeed, whether ‘in casu vel extra casum’ has the
sense which l give to it, viz, that these answers are applicable to all
arguments, but I do not know what other sense they can bear, specially
together with the context (obligatus, l. 34). Moreover‚ castis is very often
used by Wyclif in this precise sense. Compare Logica, vol. l, p. 70,
l. 25, 2t'>; p. 71. Ι. 3, 6, ιο, 11; and further in many places, in which
castis stands for the proposition put for admission and denial in the
Exercise of obligations,

The third mode is much simpler, but must, if followed, have led -
possibly with no bad results ·- to the total abandonmcnt of this Exer-

cise. lt is as if a chess·player had found an easy means to get a drawn

game in every case. You answer as you like, and deny the conclusion:
if urged, deny that there is any power of conclusion in the premissa
because in these Exercises words have no longer the meaning which
they usually bear. A man swears that he is committing perjury3 is he
doing so or not? Answer Yes or N0, as you please. If Yes, the adver·
sary then points out that you contradict yourself, since you admit that
he speaks the truth. You deny that; and when he presses you, say3
The argument is unmeaning, and has therefore no consequence at all:
the propositions have been admitted, merely because in these exerciscs
one is obliged to admit or deny them. The writer ends by pointing out
(no doubt to a very raw beginner) that such an answer cannot be used
except in these special cases (p. 154, l. 35 to p. 156, l. 8). The few
lines entitled Insolubilia Pulchra call for no comment, and are only
important because of the allusion to Wyclif which they contain. ’
