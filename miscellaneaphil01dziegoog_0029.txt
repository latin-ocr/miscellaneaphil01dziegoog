xxiv INTRODUCTION.

least universal, and one may, by God's power, he united to another ol
a higher or lower rank. This hierarchy is necessary, for the essence
cannot be made up of two or more parts independent ol one another,
and consequently accidental (p. 573 p. 58, 1—30). ·'-·- To conceive
Wyclil' s meaning more clearly, let us take ‘Something animated and
rational’ on one hand, and Something large and red’ on the other.
'Rational’ depende on ‘animated‘ and is inconceivable without it. Abeing
may be animated and rational, or animated and not rational, or neither,
but not rational and not animated; whereas we can perlectly conceive
something large and red, or large and not red or red and not large,
or neither. These, as separately conceivable, are accidental to each
other's essence‚ whilst ‘animated’ is essential to ‘rational’. .

As there are three sorts os differences, real and essential‚ real but
not essential, and merely formal difference, so there are correspondingly
three sorts os composition: quantitative, uniting parts really and essen·
tially different, and easily conceivablc3 qualitative, of matter and form,
which are really distinct, but forming only one essence as the deter-
mining and determinable parts ol the same being (that v. g. out of which
¹a watch is made, and that which makes it to be a watch); and formal
composition, the most abstruse of all, between things which differ neither
really nor essentially. Rationality‚ sor instance, added to animation, makes
Mau, these are tWO, but only lormally. This composition is very similar
to that of matter, form, and compound, as may readily be seen: and
these formal parts may be called different modes os the same being
(p. 58, l. 30 to end; p. 59—p. 60, l. 38).

We can only improperly predicate one ol these parts os the other,
and the genus, according to Aristotle, cannot in any sense be predicated
os its difference, for the idea ol the latter is outside ol the intensiori os
the former. Animalily and ralionality are, taken together, parts of the
species lauritanitu· and one part is not another. Thence it follows that
entity is not a genus, if it were, it would form a lower species by the
addition os something else, extraneous to entity3 but it is clear that
there can be no such thing (p. 60, l. 30 to p. 61, l. 30). .

A genoe, which belongs to the essence ol anything previously to

its species, must at some time or other have all its possible species, lor
otherwise it would be mutilated and incomplete (p. 61, l. 30 to p. 62,
l. 32). Wyclil returns to thisidea on p. 137, almost in the same terms
