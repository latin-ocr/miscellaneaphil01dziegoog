Vl INTRODUCTION.

1. The Manusoripts authenticity and dates ot the
works.

De Universalibus and Fragmenta take up from f. 193b to f. 259b of
MS. IV. H. G. of Prague University. Notae extends from f. 1⁸ to the eud
of f. 4b (Univ. Prag. ΙΙΙ, G. 10), with the exception of 1b and the
greater part of 2⁸, which has already been published (see Note, p. 158).
De Materia begins with f. 135⁸ of the same MS. and ends on f. 139¹&
A full description oi both the MSS. will be found in the Miscellanea
Philosophiae, Introduction, pp. LXIX, LXX.

As to their authenticity, we must first state that only De Uni·
nersalibus aud De Materia are noticed in Shirley‘s catalogue; I copied
the others in Vienna, on the chance that they might be portions of the
lost works of Wyclif, and acting under Dr. Furnivall's advice. There
are a few peculiarities. about . De Universalibus which differentiate it
from the other works of Wyclif One is the great number of mistakes
in grammar, some of which seem certainly ascribable to the writer
and not to the copyist3 another is the frequent recurrente of certain
expressions (such, for instance, as aum tunc) which are rare in the
other works. The writer’s attitude towards the Roman Church (see
p. ¹11, Ι. 30—35) and his assertion that God can, ii He chooses,
preserve accidents in being without their subjects (p. 78, l. 29-33)
— an assertion which Wyclif, even in so early atreatise as De Actibus
Animae, assailed with great vigour — may also incline us to doubt
whether this tractate was really by him, although by far the greater part
of his philosophical system is to be found therein. But we recognize
here, not only the doctrine, but the power aud subtlety of Wyclif; and
the old argument: If not by Wyclif, then by whom? naturally presents
itself since we know of no Realist contemporary worthy of mention
by his side. As to the above stated points, they are easily answered
if we note (p. 137) that the writer excuses himself for his inexperieuce
which has made him diffuse, aud write, he sayS, “satis pueriliter”. And
a few lines lower he again alludes, not without a touch of pride, to his
“pueriles deductiones”. If we assume that we have here Wyclif's very
earliest work extant, mistakes of grammar, awkwardness of repeated

expressions, orthodoxy as concerns Rome, and even his belief in “ab-
solute accidents‘’ are all explained. ,For my own part, I have no doubt

that the work is authentic.
