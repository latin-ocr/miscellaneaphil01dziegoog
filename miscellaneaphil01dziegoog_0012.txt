INTRODUCTION. VII

De Materia is so mutilated that it is difficult to iorm any judgment
at all conceruing it. Its authenticity, sofar as Ι cau see, amounts to
this: We bave no reason to believe that it is not by Wyclif, since it is
his doctrine, and written in a style indistiuguishable from his. lt is true
(see Note, p. 170) that a work ascribed to Johalrues Huss de Hussynetz
has the “incipit” and the first page, but the fust 'page only, identical
with this work. But Huss‚ as has been amply shown by Dr. Loserth
more than once, was what we moderns would call aplagiary os Wyclil;
and the circumstance that only the first page is identical seems rather
to show that Huss borrowed it from the present tractate, 3ηά that this
tractate is by his master's hand.

Fragmenta, as Ι found when copying the last lines (p. 156,
l.16-17) are by another author. Nevertheless, these fragments are quite
in their place here, They were evidently written by some disciple‚ who
in all probability copied them with iusignifrcant additions from some
oi the lost works oi Wyelil.

Notae et Questiones Variae have about as much authenticity as
De Materia, save that De Materia alone is mentioned in Shirley’s Ca·
talogue. Apoint in their favour is also the fact that one of these
“Notae'' is identical with one of the Questiones Tredeaim, already pu·
blished with De Compositiane Hominis.

We may set aside the question oi the dates ol these last short
tractates as impossible to answer‚ but that of De Universatibns may be
approximately fixed. Granting that it is by Wyclif, itis certainly earlier
than De Actibus Animae, itseli earlier than Logica. The admission of
“Absolute Accidents‘', already mentioned, which Wyclis combated during

therhole oi his subsequent career, seems to be a sufficient prooi oi this3
besides, there are indications here 3ηά there in the work that the cosmo·
logical system oi “punctal atoms‘’, so carefully elaborated in Logica,
which (as we have elsewhere shown) clashes with the idea os accidents

separated from asubstance 3ηά finally comes into collision with the
doctrine of Transubstantiadon itsell, was not yet fully developed. As
I showed in Miscellanea‚ vol. I, p. XXXIII, De Actibus Animae was not
much, it at all, anterior to WycliI's Mastership at Balliol College. It is
very probable that the present work was written by him when an under·
graduate3 though os course the precise date cannot be ascertained.
