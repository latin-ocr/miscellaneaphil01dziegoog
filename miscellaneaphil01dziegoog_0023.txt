XVIII INTRODUCTION.

mitting that many great philosophers (multos famosos, p. 37, l. 12) held
the opinion which he thinks is inadmissible, and even quoting one of
the greatest, Aristotle (p, 39, l. 8, 9). lt seems therefore advisable to

analyse the paragraphs from p. 37, l. 12 to p. 40, l. 12, with special
care, not omitting to give (where necessary) the replies which might be
made by upholders of this doctrine, so as both to show the difference
between Wyclif's system and theirS, and to point out the misconception
under which Ι think he laboured.

Many great writers compare the Universal with Primordial Matter,
in so far as the latter is never bereft of all forms, and is only conceived
as thus bereft by the act of our mind which can think it without thinking
of thern, In like manner the nature of a thing does not exist apart from
its concrete conditions of existence, but may be thought apart from them
by the mind3 its universality is therefore a mere abstraction, and a fiction

produced by our intellect (p. 37, l. 12-30). Moderate Realists, admitting ’

the greater part of this exposition of their theory, would dissent from
its conclusion, or at least point out a distinction here. Universality, for-
mally considered, is indeed a mere abstraction; but that from which we
abstractis truly and really such that we are enabled to think it as uni·
versui. 'The resemblances between beings exist before they are thought
of as resemblances3 before they are actually joined together by one
general idea, they are in themselves and truly capable of being thus
joined together. They are indeed not universal in the way that our
notion of thern is; but they supply the basis in fact of that very univer·
sality, which we therefore cannot call a mere fiction.

Wyclif admits that there is in the mind an act of abstractiou by
which the Subjective Universal, or the general idea, is formed. But he
rejects the comparison with Primordial Matter as quite worthless. As a
fact, Matter exists, not in time indeed, but in its nature, previously to
any of its determinations, and this separate existence does not by any
means depend upon our thought of it. Now the same may be said of
Universals. The nature of man (or Humanity) for instance, exists (not
. indeed in time but in its esseuce) previously to any individual man3 when
we abstract from individuale wc do not make Humanity, we only frud it.
The truth of things cannot depend on the truth of our thoughts con·
cerning them (p. 37, l. 30 to p. 39, l. 3). - To this the reply would
probably be that all Wyclif says here is quite true, but beside the mark.
