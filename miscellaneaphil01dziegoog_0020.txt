lNTRODUCTlON. XV,

Moreover, to deny Universals is to deny Scripture, ln Genesis it
is said that God created animals in their genera and species. This cannot
mean ‘according to their Archetypes’, since ‘in’ is not synonymous with
‘according to’. Nor does it mean our ideas or the words we use to
signify them, nor the multitude of particular animals that have existed
or will exist since God did not create them all at that time. 'l‘he words
must stand for the essential resemblances ol things, which are in the
things, and afford a foundation for classisrcation3 il not, they are utterly
unmeaning (p. 27, l. 34 to end ol chapter).

Chapter VI. Universals are thus the intrinsic formal causes ol par·
ticular beings tf it seems hard to think that one formal cause can exist
identically in many particulars, rememb‘er that many such particulars may
have one and the same efficient, final and material cause: why make an
exception lor formal causes alone? The adversaries will here quote
Aristotle: Form is that which separates and distinguishes This is true;
but form separates those things which have it from those which have it
not: it joins together all those ol the same species. As we know, the
loss os a form entails separation and dissolution in the beings which
lose it. Those who say that a form cannot exist in more than one being
would curtail God's Omnipotence. Not only one particular fire but all
sire is lire; every peasant knows that, and thus tacitly admits auniversal
Form ol igneity. He does not indeed explicitly assert it, nor does he
know anything about the proposition affirming it; all the sanie he knows
perfectly well that the thing is true. And even learned men who verb·
ally deny the existence ol Universals are often forced to admit them as
a matter of fact (p. 29-p. 31, l. 28).

lndeed, a universal lact (All lire is sne) is more certainly known
than its particular (This frre is fire); andis it were not so, no principle
ol science would be more sels-evident than the particulars deduced there-

lrom. ln lact, those principles would be no more than mere aggregatos

ol particular propositions, and there would be no inserence at all. But
they exist, and whether known and uttered by us or not, they are inde·
pendent ol the laets which they determine. Really‚ there is no need to
prove this, nor is it possible to reason with an adversary who denies
the objective existence of light, colour, sound, etc. Being in general, and
sensible Being in particular, once admitted, open the door to the ad·
mission ol the Universal. To deny it is like denying the Principle ol
