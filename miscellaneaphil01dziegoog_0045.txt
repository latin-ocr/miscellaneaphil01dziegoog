quently, that All positive entities (omne genitum) have eternal existence
(esse) p. 167—168. We cannot, oi anything that has existed or will

exist (positive entines) say absolutely, “This does not exist''. Since itis
eternally true that it will exist or has existed, the ‘will exist’ or ‘has
existed' is eternal; and this truth being identical with concy, some entity
must therefore be everlastingly predicable ol this being, and no absolute
negation of its existence can be true. Therefore everything exists (in a
sense) eternally; but we must distinguish between its inlelligible existence,
its becuming, and its specific being. Only the first is everlasting. Thus
sar Wyclii; but it is easily conceivable that his sollowers may have pro·
eeeded sarther. For the ‘becoming‘ of any being is eternally true, and
so is its specific being; and if we distinguish between its ‘intelligible
becoming' and its ‘becoming as a fact', then it may be urged that ‘be-
coming as a lact’ is also cternnlly true. The argument might be continued
indefinitely, with an indefinite number oi distinctions neither assailaut
nor deiender being worsted.

V. Analysis of De Materia.

Though the text of this tractate is less corrupt than that of the
former three, il we consider each sentence in particular, it is not less
difficult to analyze than they are. There is a great gap, — l think
between pages 172 and 1733 indeed it would seem as though what
precedes p. 173 has no connection whatever with the rest of the
treatise. The title, De Materia, is merely conjectura} (see Shirley’s Cata·
logne) and nothing more is said about matter aster p. 172. This indeed
is not a sufficient reason to conclude that these two parts arc fragments
of different treatises, sor Wyclif is often given to wandering lar from his
subject; but it authorizes us in analyzing the two parts separately.

First Part (p. 170—173). Primal matter never can be a predicate.
This means, not that we cannot say ol any given body, This is matter;
but that it is the first underlying subject of all sorms; all forms or
determinations are therefore predicable ol it, and not vice verso. We say
truly, This is matter, but then we mean determined matter, not the first
underlying subject. The question is, whether this primordial matter is
absolutely lormless in its essence. Wyclis proceeds to solve the problem,

noting the different terms used to denote matter, form, ‘and compound,'
